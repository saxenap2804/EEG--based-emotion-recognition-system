# EEG--based-emotion-recognition-system

## Introduction:  
Emotion recognition is challenging due to limitations in single data sources (like EEG or facial expressions) and the high cost of labeling emotional data, leading to a scarcity of labeled datasets.

## Problem Statement:  
Existing methods struggle with integrating diverse data types and rely heavily on labeled data, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios with limited labeled resources.

## Proposed Solution:  
The project introduces a semi-supervised deep learning framework that combines data from multiple modalities, leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data to improve emotion recognition accuracy and robustness while automatically adapting to the importance of each data source.
